## DASHBOARD

# Little Code Challenge

-> find the deployed version here: https://dashboard-jmp-berlin.herokuapp.com/

for the purpose of trying, I didnt use any styling library and did the responsive stuff with manual media queries.

unfortunately the BVG-API isnt working sometimes and is down every now and then. So, if the wheel just keeps spinning, its propably that.

Other than that, I used React in the front-end, Node.js, Express and MongoDb in the backend.

APIs: Twitter, Openweathermap and transport-rest-API
