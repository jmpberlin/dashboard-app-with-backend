# DASHBOARD

little code challenge

-> find the deployed version here: https://dashboard-jmp-berlin.herokuapp.com/

for the purpose of trying, I didnt use any styling library and did the responsive stuff with "manual" media queries.

unfortunately the BVG-API isnt working sometimes and is down every now and then. So, if the wheel just keeps spinning, it's that.

APIs: Twitter, Openweathermap and transport-rest-API
