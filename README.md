# Dashboard

# a little dashboard-app utilizing 4 external Apis

-> find the deployed version here: https://dashboard-jmp-berlin.herokuapp.com/

-> for the purpose of trying, I didnt use any styling library and did the responsive stuff with "manual" media queries.

-> unfortunately the transport.rest-API is down since a few days (12th Dec) and so the BVG-Component is utterly useless atm and also not really styled since I couldn't receive any data from it in the development process. Once It's up, I'll get back to it.

-> APIs: Twitter, Openweathermap and transport.rest-API, Mapbox
